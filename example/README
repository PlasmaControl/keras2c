This folder contains a basic example for how to use keras2c. The hdf5 file "model.h5" is an already trained keras model saved using the model.save() method. Running make_example.py will generate 3 C files. The files example.c/h contain the keras model implemented in pure C, and example_test_suite.c contains a test suite to evaluate the model. Run "$ make all" to compile the generated code. To run the test suite, do "$ ./example". The binary "astyle" is required for keras2c to generate code.
